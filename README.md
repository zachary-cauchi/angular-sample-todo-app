A sample todo app as an intermediate angular tutorial.
The aims of this project are as follows:

## MVP goals

* [x] Generate the base angular app.

    * Date created
    * Message content
    * Is completed
* [x] Create a user interface for the todo app using mock todo data.
* [x] Use server to store and supply todos.
* [x] Add interface for creating new todos.
* [x] Add ability to delete todos.

## Extended goals
* [ ] Add users (no initial ) for per-user todos.
* [ ] Add server-side JWT authentication.
* [ ] Add login page to authenticate users.
* [ ] Add signup page to create new users.

## ToDo App

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 14.0.1.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.

## Further help

To get more help on the Angular CLI use `ng help` or go check out the [Angular CLI Overview and Command Reference](https://angular.io/cli) page.
